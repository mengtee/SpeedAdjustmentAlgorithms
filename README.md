# SUMO TraCI Simulation

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to run a SUMO TraCI simulation.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility): Installation Guide
Python: Download Python
TraCI (Traffic Control Interface): This is included with SUMO, but you might need the Python TraCI library.
You can install the Python TraCI library using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install sumo-traCI
Repository Structure
simulation.sumocfg: The main configuration file for the SUMO simulation.
map.net.xml: The network file defining the road layout.
routes.rou.xml: The routes file defining vehicle routes.
traCI_script.py: The Python script to run the TraCI simulation.
Instructions to Run the Simulation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Step 2: Verify SUMO Installation
Ensure that SUMO is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH. You can verify this by running:

bash
Copy code
sumo --version
Step 3: Run the SUMO Simulation
Without TraCI: To run the simulation without TraCI, execute:

bash
Copy code
sumo -c simulation.sumocfg
With TraCI: To run the simulation using the TraCI Python script, execute:

bash
Copy code
python traCI_script.py
Step 4: Visualize the Simulation (Optional)
To visualize the simulation, use the SUMO GUI:

bash
Copy code
sumo-gui -c simulation.sumocfg
Configuration
simulation.sumocfg
This file contains the main configuration settings for your simulation. Ensure that the paths to the network and route files are correctly set.

map.net.xml
This file defines the road network. You can create or edit this file using NETEDIT, which comes with SUMO.

routes.rou.xml
This file defines the routes for the vehicles in the simulation. You can specify different routes, vehicle types, and more.

traCI_script.py
This is the Python script that uses TraCI to interact with the running SUMO simulation. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and modify the script according to your simulation requirements.

Troubleshooting
SUMO not found: Ensure SUMO is installed and added to your PATH.
Python errors: Ensure all required Python libraries are installed.
Configuration errors: Double-check the paths in your simulation.sumocfg file.
